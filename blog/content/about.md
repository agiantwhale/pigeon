I won a drone for the ["Best Security Hack"](http://devpost.com/software/biometric-2-factor-security) from [MHacks 6](http://mhacks.org/).

So I decided to build a pet drone with it.

This blog is just a documentation of my progress - you probably won't find anything valuable here.

Come check out other stuff I'm doing at my [website](https://jae.works/).
