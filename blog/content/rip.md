After crashing numerous times while writing software for Pigeon, the central cross finally broke down.
I started seeing red lights on the back two propellers, probably was not a good idea to ignore them.

I might buy some repair kits to fix the drone. Or I might as well just call it quits.
If the latter, I will start updating this blog with work I am dong for [MAAV](http://maavumich.org/).
